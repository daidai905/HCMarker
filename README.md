**#Precautions**


Please check the Idents of your seurat object to ensure that the Idents are clear



**Use displays**


1. If you enter a single seurat object


HCMarker(files ="test1.rds",species ="ara",tissue ="root", percent ="0.8",num="0.5",papers = "PRJNA111")


2.If you enter two or more seurat objects


HCMarker(files=c("test1.rds","test2.rds"),species = "ara",tissue ="root", percent = "0.8", num="0.5",papers = c("PRJNA111","PRJNA222"))



**Input and output interpretation**


**Input: **


files: one or more seurat objects

species: species name

tissue: tissue name 

percent: what percentage of genes you want to keep according to each indicator (pct1, pct2, proportion, avg_Log2FC, COSG_score)

num:  how many genes you want to select with a high confidence score or greater

papers: the name of the subfolder created for each seurat object



**Output: **


zj_matrix.txt:A matrix of evidence numbers formed by the genes screened out from the entered percent

score.txt：A matrix of high confidence scores formed by the genes screened out from the entered percent

'num'.txt: High confidence markers for each cell type formed based on the high-confidence score matrix and the input num

Each subfolder of the output includes:

*_sx.txt:Based on the value of the percent entered, each data eligible gene is determined

find_marker.txt：A file generated by the findAllMarkers command generated by the seurat package

cosg_500.txt ：A file generated by the cosg command of the COSG package
